| ReactJS Basic Concepts                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                         |

| Introduction to JSX                                                          | JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for React.js that allows developers to write HTML elements.                                              |
| Rendering Elements                                                           | Rendering Elements in React involves efficiently updating the user interface by creating and updating virtual representations of the UI components. |
| Components                                                                   | Components in React are modular, reusable building blocks for UI elements.                                                                          |
| Fragments                                                                    | We may render a single element or multiple elements, though rendering multiple elements will require a ‘div’ tag called Fragment                    |
| Props                                                                        | React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props.                                                                    |
| PropTypes                                                                    | use the propType for validating any data we are receiving from props.                                                                               |
| States                                                                       | React JS State is a way to store and manage the information or data while creating a React Application.                                             |
| Conditional Rendering                                                        | Rendering based on the conditions called conditional rendering in React.                                                                            |
| React JS Lists/ React JS Keys/ React JS Refs/ React JS forms/ React JS Hooks |1. React Lists are very useful when it comes to developing the UI of any website <br/2. React JS keys are a way of providing a unique identity to each item while creating the React JS Lists so that React can identify the element to be processed.<br/>3. React JS Refs are used to access and modify the DOM elements in the React Application.<br/>4. In React Forms, All the form data is stored in the React’s component state<br/>5. Hooks are used to give functional components an access to use the states and are used to manage side-effects in React. |
| Router | In React mostly SPA are developed so Navigation is complex. |
| ReactDOM | React provides the developers with a package react-dom to access and modify the DOM. |
| EventHandling | Modern webpages rely on user interactions, triggering events like clicks or keypresses. |
| Synthetic Events | Synthetic events in React are cross-browser wrappers around the browser’s original event. |
| ContextAPI | Context API is used to pass global variables anywhere in the code. |
| Controlled Components | React’s Controlled Components manage form data via component state, receiving values through props and updating through callbacks like onChange. |
